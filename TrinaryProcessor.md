The concept is feasable due to the fact that PCI interfaces such as PCI-E and others allow a software layer to usher the processing from the trinary processor that is commanded by either a GPU or CPU. The lower level memory storage in the processor itself is of the nature of 64 bits to 128 bits with support for both with certain opcode operations. The design above is mostly a distinct design that was taken from me that Intel would have, and now invested in by Government(s). There is a more advanced featured processor, that would run like a trinary processor, yet is still binary in the sense of direct communication so that it could be a replacement for a GPU or a CPU processor. There still is a bottleneck which is described below that is solved using other newer technology that may be developed in conjuction with this processor.

Thank you.


# An Addition to the bottleneck


__SHORT__ 255 ------- Input(s)
                     /----->|-----------g---------------|---\___________________ -------- Output
[External Cores^n] -/------>|-----------r---------------|----\____/_____________ -------- Output 
                    \------>|-----------b---------------|----/___/______________ -------- Output
                     \----->|-----------i---------------|---/___/_______________ -------- Output

The letters above in this section are for spectrum of colors (g) green (r) red (b) blue (i) intensity [as a multiplier]. The processor design may turn to be so fast that a short input to generate light across an apparatus that will handle such things, or in my case actually hold colored light without the need for continuous generation of the light spectrum desired. So therefore the spectrum of light colors are merely a depiction of the possibilities with different materials that are available and developed by me. As the processor above may generate so fast, that multiple cores would require additional bottleneck mitigating features, that this then could be offloaded into other processors to then slow down the processing for human consumption. If no large language text model for output is required, potentially the processing can all happen and outputed as fast as it can be stored on a storage device. The concept then therefore allows for the fastest possible known way along with the addition of implementing propietary methods when reducing the processing for human readability or when interfacing with other systems after. The below diagram could give insight into tha possible slow down by using capacitors that will absorb the energy given by the power source to an equivalent speed of the interface itself.

[IC] ---> |0.5|uf -------> [SERIAL]
[IC] ---> |0.5|uf -------> [BUS]
[IC] ---> |0.5|uf -------> [RAM]
[IC] ---> |0.5|uf -------> [etcetera]


The processor itself uses radio energy as well as the variaying polarity of the input power as well as a material to hold another piece of data, which could be a memory location which is pretty common these days, but to achieve full capabilities of the speed potential of the processor, it is suggested to use a more modern approach such as light energy passed through to another device or integrated circuitry or dedicated processor to handle such processing. This has been created in a prototype and proven to work, and it was able to achieve well over unconscionable amounts of data per second in the application tested was data transmission and processing which has pretty powerful technology for passing data along transmission lines or fiberoptics. So apart from the application of Artificial Intelligence, it is also applicable to network devices to improve the ability to send larger amounts of data faster, where the bottleneck is not so much the transmission or copper line itself, but the handing off or processing of the data from the transmit and receive side of things.


This is now in the public domain as of around April 2014 or so.
