# Space Momentum Propulsion AKA Intertia Generator

| --------     |
  ^^^^^^^^<------Is a weight on a track or conveyor that slams

A weight that bangs back and forth smoothly to take enertia from kinetic to potential energy and then introduce into a zero gravity environment to move a vehicle.

The weight moves fast in one direction, and then slowly moves back to a position to engage potential energy, to be released quickly either by spring or other motion to move it quickly in the movement direction.
This is kind of like a gyro but a gyro not used to stabalize and soften kinetic energy introduced by other propulsion techniques.

1. Weight slowly moves in one direction to gain potential energy.
2. Weight is then released quickly and propelled in the oposite or in the direction of the desired motion depending upon implementation.

This could also be put on an arch type apparatus to capture more of the potential enrgy when transferred into kinetic energy, with a catching mechanism at the other side that prevents movement backwards from the forward push. A spring may not work ultimately to launch the weight in the most efficient way, as a convereyor with two opposing motors will offset the torque introduced by rotating motors. A spring is possible to work if you don't mind a jerky motion and assume the weight is going one way to come back the otherway to force the kinetic energy into the original direction of the position of weight's original potential energy position.

The arch technique would have a stopper with a latching device to arrest the movement so as to transfer the energy into the vehicle being propelled in the most efficient manner.
The spring technique would also have to have an arresting device that immediatly stops the weight in its movement and prevents it from returning immediately while vectored motion is still happening in the desired direction.

This can also be used to break, as a software aspect can be implemented to sense the speed and acceleration of the weight being thrown around to produce movement in zero gravity, as to then have control to move the spring. This may cause momentary times of no acceleration but these inertia generators can be used in tandum to generate vectored motion while one or the other is arming and gaining potential energy while the other is releasing the kinetic energy into the vehicles velocity.
