        p2
  

Sound gernerated from multiple drections and directed into a somewhat open area that can be configured with object and furniture to cause that when two individuals are talking to
eachother across the plane of the Audio Capture Void there can be a defense of the potential that no audio can be recorded on modern devices. Using the concept of two complementary sounds will cause cancelation.
In the most basic implementation there would be a need for the individuals talking across the Audio Capture Void to speak within a certain frequency range, so this could work more readily for
analog, or actual people talking to eachother in this configuration.

The alternative implementations can generate sound and with other implementations can cause long range audio capture, but easily thwarted by other techniques and laws of sound cause to be preventable.
