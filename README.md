The concept is feasable due to the fact that PCI interfaces such as PCI-E and others allow a software layer to usher the processing from the trinary processor that is commanded by either a GPU or CPU. The lower level memory storage in the processor itself is of the nature of 64 bits to 128 bits with support for both with certain opcode operations. The design above is mostly a distinct design that was taken from me that Intel would have, and now invested in by Government(s). There is a more advanced featured processor, that would run like a trinary processor, yet is still binary in the sense of direct communication so that it could be a replacement for a GPU or a CPU processor. There still is a bottleneck which is described below that is solved using other newer technology that may be developed in conjuction with this processor.

Thank you.

This is now in the public domain as of around April 2015 or so.
