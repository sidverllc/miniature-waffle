# Space Momentum Propulsion


| --------     |
  ^^^^^^^^<------Is a weight on a track or conveyor that slams

A weight that bangs back and forth smoothly to take enertia from kinetic to potential energy and then introduce into a zero gravity environment to move a vehicle.

The weight moves fast in one direction, and then slowly moves back to a position to engage potential energy, to be released quickly either by spring or other motion to move it quickly in the movement direction.
This is kind of like a gyro but a gyro not used to stabalize and soften kinetic energy introduced by other propulsion techniques.

1. Weight slowly moves in one direction to gain potential energy.
2. Weight is then released quickly and propelled in the oposite or in the direction of the desired motion depending upon implementation.
