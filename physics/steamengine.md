# Nuclear Powered Steam Engine

A core within a purified water jacket container, that has a pressure valve to allow steam to be released onto a fan that generates electrical power. Water is placed around the container to heat up by the material inside
the container that naturally heats. Heat is abated by the water around the container and the heat transfered into other energy, and in this case into electrical batteries.
