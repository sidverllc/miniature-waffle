# A Good Golf Swing

## Legs

* Stand like your sitting at the edge of a bar stool, but comfortably.

_Ball Placement_
1. Drivers: Balls should be more back in your stance towards your back foot; if teed you have more room to be a little off center, or left of center, from the ball. 
1. Irons: Middle to front foot placement of the ball; depending on the lie could adjust ball placement between the feet.
1. Woods: Similar to Drivers, but depending on the lie it is better to be more centered over the ball.

* Legs should finish with a figure K and your belly pointing at your target.

## Torso

* Square with your feet. One way to be sure is placing a club perpendicular to your feet and seeing where you think the ball is aimed at.

* Your body should rotate during the back swing and return to its starting position as you swing through the ball and your body rotates for your belly to be pointing towards your balls target.

## Arms

* Should be in a locked position that is comfortable but pretty much as far as comfortable from your body for maximum space for a proper swing. Bringing the dominant elbow closer to the body
can allow for a better trajectory when taking the club through the back swing, though this part doesn't matter too too much, it is helpful to have a smooth swing for many reasons.
* When reachhing the back swing, your dominant elbow should be in a 90 degree angle with the forearm and bicep up and paralell with the ground _|.
* On the down swing, with the arms in a 90 degree angle, it allows you to pull the club downward for maximum control of the speed into the ball. __Tip:__ Start slower as this is a bit tough to understand, but it permits a pulling bicep/tricep muscle
action to gain more velocity in the swing, which needs to be found the right velocity, not the fastest, unless you have the proper balls and clubs that can work well with that. Harder and faster is not always better
depending on the equipment.

## Head

* Head should be chin up enough so it doesn't get in the way of the swing and looking in the direction of the ball until the club hits the ball or darn near close to contact with the club and ball.

## Hands

* Various grips, but the one preferred by most is thumb goes on the club lined up as if it went into the middle of the opposite hands palm.

## Summary

This gives you a basic technique of a golf swing. But like all my other descriptions on here, there are a lot of technical aspects to golf, that would take pages and pages to describe. This should
up your game though. Watch some golf on television and then see how this all fits together with the information above.
